                <p>In the past 20 plus years, I have been a Quality Assurance Engineer, a Product Owner, and in my
                    current
                    avatar, am a Software Engineer.</p>
                <p>I am also an avid hiker and backpacker - so if you love to hike or backpack, I bet we have a lot to
                    talk
                    about !!</p>

            <section id="about-me" class="hidden">
                <h3>Let me tell you about my journey to my current avatar !</h3>
                <p>I started working in 1998 and started my career as a web developer intern, creating prototypes for
                    Citibank India Technology. As I continued to code, an oppurtunity opened up on the Testing team and
                    I
                    went into Performance Testing with LoadRunner and Functional Testing with WinRunner.. Many years
                    passed
                    and I continued down the Quality Assurance path, working for a startup as well as being absorbed
                    into a
                    larger company. </p>
                <p>About 5 years ago I decided to foray into the Product Requirement side.. Having been on the Testing
                    side,
                    I knew how important it was to get proper requirements written up so that the code, that eventually
                    makes it's way to testing, is what the end user really wants to use. </p>
                <p>Finally having been on both sides of the software development process (product requirements and
                    testing
                    the end product) has made me realize what I really want to get back to is to CODE ! To create what
                    makes
                    the websites come alive and interact with the end user !! So here I am.. coding away in HTML, CSS
                    and
                    JavaScript and hoping to learn more.. </p>
                <p>But I won't leave you hanging about the Hiking portion of my intro :) I have always been a day hiker
                    and
                    that is what we like to do for fun as a family - we find day hikes wherever we travel and even my
                    youngest can hike upto 7 miles a day. I really got into backpacking during covid (when the entire
                    world
                    had a revelation of some sort!). I have been doing small backpacking trips ever since and hopefully
                    one
                    day I will hike the big 3 - the Pacific Crest trail (PCT), the Appalachian trail (AT) and the
                    Continental Divide trail (CDT) !!</p>
