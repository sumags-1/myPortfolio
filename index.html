                        I am also an avid hiker and backpacker.. <br>So if you love to hike or backpack, I bet we have a
                        lot
                        to talk about !!

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I started my career in 1998 as a web developer intern, creating prototypes for
                    Citibank India Technology. Shortly thereafter, an oppurtunity opened up on the Testing team
                    particulartly in Functional and Performance Testing. Many years passed and I continued down the
                    Testing and Quality Assurance path, working for a startup (TrustedID) and eventually for Equifax
                </p>
                <p>About 5 years ago I decided to foray into the Product Requirements side.. Having been on the Testing
                    side, I knew how important it was to get proper requirements written up so that the code, that
                    eventually makes it's way to testing, is what the end user really wants to use. </p>
                <p>Finally having been on both sides of the software development process (product requirements and
                    testing
                    the end product) has made me realize what I really want to get back to is to CODE ! To create what
                    makes the websites come alive and interact with the end user !! So here I am.. coding away in HTML,
                    CSS
                    and JavaScript and hoping to learn more.. </p>
                <p>But I won't leave you hanging about the Hiking portion of my intro :) I have always been a day hiker
                    and really got into backpacking during covid (when most of the world had a revelation of some
                    sort!). I have been doing backpacking trips ever since and hopefully one day I will hike the big 3 -
                    the Pacific Crest trail (PCT), the Appalachian trail (AT) and the
                    Continental Divide trail (CDT) !!</p>
