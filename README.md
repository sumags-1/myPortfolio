- As a HR manager, I want to be able to see the skills and other relevant information in detail so I can also assess if this candidate is a fit for the position I am trying to fill.
- As a technical interviewer, I want to be able to see the projects and code written by the candidate in detail so I can evaluate their strengths and weaknesses as it pertains to coding.
- As a technical manager, I want an overview of the projects the candidate has completed so I can evaluate if said candidate is competent for the role I am hiring for.


Original wireframe (which later changed due to issues with sticky nav):





MVP site (before further CSS changes):




Hurdles:
1. My original navigation was going to be on the right bottom of the screen. I was able to achieve this for screen size more than 600px BUT for a smaller screen, the navigation had to be redone. This changed the entire navigation. 
2. Site was lack luster after MVP was done, even though it was fully functional (see screenshot above). I wanted to add more interest in terms of adding background images, changing up the fonts etc. This resulted in a much different final site than originally planned.
